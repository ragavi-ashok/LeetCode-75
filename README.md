# 🚀 LeetCode Interview Prep – Problem-Solving Strategies

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository contains my solutions to **75 LeetCode problems**, focusing on an **interview-style problem-solving approach**. The goal is not just to solve problems but to **think like an interviewer**, improve problem-solving skills, and help others by sharing insights.

I will be **uploading solutions regularly**, aiming to solve **3 problems per day**. Each solution includes:
- **Thought process**: How to break down and approach the problem.
- **Key questions to ask**: What to clarify before coding.
- **Brute force vs. optimized approach**: Trade-offs and improvements.
- **Time & space complexity**: Understanding efficiency.

## 🏆 Why I’m Doing This
- To **strengthen** my ability to solve problems efficiently in interviews.
- To **develop** structured thinking for algorithmic challenges.
- To **help others** by sharing solutions and insights.

Each file contains:
- **Problem statement**  
- **Approach & explanation**  
- **Code implementation (Python)**  
- **Complexity analysis**
